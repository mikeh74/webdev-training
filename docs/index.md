# Web Development Training

Welcome to the Web Development Training documentation! This repository is 
designed as a comprehensive learning resource for aspiring web developers,
covering everything from fundamental web technologies to building full-stack
applications with Django.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a structured learning path for web development, providing:

- **Foundational Knowledge**: Understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - the
core technologies of the web
- **Practical Exercises**: Hands-on coding challenges to build real-world skills
- **Framework Training**: Introduction to Django for building production-ready
web applications
- **Career Guidance**: Overview of different roles and paths in web development

## Getting Started

If you're new to web development, we recommend starting with these
foundational topics:

1. **[Job Roles in Web Development](job-roles.md)** - Understand the landscape
of web development careers
2. **[Introduction to Web Development](intro-to-web.md)** - Learn about HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals

## Learning Path

Clone or download the repo from github and then start working through the
HTML and Javascript exercises.

Complete 3-4 exercises before moving to JavaScript and then complete 3-4 of
those before moving on to Django.
