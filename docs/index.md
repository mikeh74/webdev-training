# Web Development Training

Welcome to the Web Development Training documentation! This repository is 
designed as a comprehensive learning resource for aspiring web developers,
covering everything from fundamental web technologies to building full-stack
applications with Django.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a structured learning path for web development, providing:

core technologies of the web
- **Practical Exercises**: Hands-on coding challenges to build real-world skills
- **Framework Training**: Introduction to Django for building production-ready
web applications

## Getting Started

If you're new to web development, we recommend starting with these
foundational topics:
