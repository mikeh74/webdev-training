# Introduction to Web Development

Web development is the practice of building and maintaining websites and web applications. At its core, modern web development relies on three fundamental technologies that work together to create interactive and visually appealing experiences on the internet.

## The Three Pillars of Web Development

### 1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

HTML is the backbone of every web page, providing the structure and content. It uses a system of tags to define elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. Think of HTML as the skeleton of a webpage — it defines what content exists and how it's organized.

**Key Concepts:**
- Semantic elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`)
- Forms and input elements
- Links and navigation
- Multimedia embedding (images, video, audio)

### 2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS controls the visual presentation of HTML elements. It determines colors, layouts, fonts, spacing, and responsive design (how it appears on different devices).

**Key Concepts:**
- Selectors and specificity
- Box model (margin, border, padding, content)
- Flexbox and Grid layouts
- Responsive design with media queries
- Animations and transitions

### 3. JavaScript

JavaScript brings interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It's a full-featured programming language that runs in the browser, allowing you to respond to user actions, manipulate HTML and CSS in real-time, fetch data from servers, and create complex web applications.

**Key Concepts:**
- Variables, data types, and operators
- Functions and scope
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Asynchronous programming (Promises, async/await)
- APIs and data fetching

## How They Work Together

These three technologies are complementary and work together to power the web:

1. **HTML** defines the content and structure: "This is a button"
2. **CSS** defines the appearance: "Make the button blue with rounded corners"
3. **JavaScript** defines the behavior: "When the button is clicked, show an alert"

## Getting Started

To begin developing for the web:

1. Start with HTML basics and build simple static pages
2. Learn CSS to style pages and create layouts
3. Add JavaScript to make pages interactive
4. Practice by building out a small project
