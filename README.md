### 2. Complete the Coding Exercises

Work through the hands-on exercises before moving on to the main project. Aim
to complete 3 or 4 from each section:

- **[HTML & CSS Exercises](./html-exercises/README.md)** — practise building
and styling web pages
- **[JavaScript Exercises](./javascript-exercises/README.md)** — practise
adding interactivity with JavaScript

### 3. Build the Django Project

Once you are comfortable with the exercises, move on to the guided Django project:

- **[Django Project](./django/README.md)** — a full back-end web application
built with Python and Django
