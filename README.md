# Web Development

## Introduction

There are a number of roles in web development and it is useful to be aware of the kinds of roles that are available. Depending on the nature and size of each organisation you may find that some of these roles overlap or a job role may incorporate several of these roles:

**[Overview of Job Roles](./docs/job-roles.md)**

The backbone of the web is built on HTML, CSS and Javascript. Knowledge of these three technologies are essential for many roles in web development:

**[Introduction to Web Development](./docs/intro-to-web.md)**

On top of these technologies you are likely to come across other programming languages which are used in the back end, such as Python, PHP, Java or Ruby. We will be using Python with Django as the back end for our main project.
